things to try:

- max_vote() (3%)
    - max vote (majority voting and fallback to max prob for tie breaker)
- use exponential moving average of parameters (LSTM weights, biases) (2-4%)
- limiting answer length to 10 words bc 90% of answers have short answers (1%)

things to evaluate:

- do dataset analysis (context length, question length, answer length, where in context is answer)
- performance of different models
